# swarm_mission_planning_srv
A ROS2 service that plans missions for swarms.

## Getting started

On one terminal:

```console
ros2 run mission_planner_srv service
```

and on another:

```console
ros2 run mission_planner_srv client
```

to get the main idea of what's going on.

Tested on amd64: foxy, galactic, and humble.
